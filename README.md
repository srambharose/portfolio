ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sathya.  

This will serve as my portfolio to support my application for the Marketing & Communications Coordinator position with SHN Foundation. 

It's split into three main sections: Cornell Detailing, TooSix Productions and Scarborough Health Network:



**1. Cornell Detailing**

- This is an auto detailing brand that I created in September 2022. I have spent a considerable amount of time researching and designing the logo, UI/UX, style guide, colour palette, font choices and the overall feel of the brand. All webpages were designed in Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/SQxidSxgscnmfaBj1BJIXf/Cornell-Detailing-v2?node-id=0-1&t=IS19FE4tZcq617Uv-1

- I wrote all of the HTML, CSS and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code. I purchased the domains, and configured the web and email hosting. Here's the live site: www.cornelldetailing.com

- I use MailChimp to manage the email marketing campaigns, here's an example of the most recent campaign:

- I am familiar with digital marketing concepts and current SEO practices. I've successfully used Google Ads to generate new leads and double the year-over-year revenue. Here's an example of the latest ad:

- I manage the social media presence across various channels, including Instagram (where I showcase the before and after pictures) and TikTok (where I use CapCut to demonstrate my video production skills to create before and after videos).

**2. TooSix Productions**

- This project started in Novemeber 2016. I wanted to challenge myself to produce video reviews, and to grow my communication and creative skills. The videos on this channel demonstrate my script writing, video production, video editing (Premiere Pro) and animation (After Effects) skills:

**3. Scarborough Health Network**

- Miro was used extensively during my time as a Jr. Consultant on the Project Management & Improvement team at SHN. Miro is similar to Figma. I used it to design various documents including process maps and team-based models for stakeholders of several different projects such as the 3MBW Refresh project, Diabetes Education Centre staff consolidation project, Centralized Patient Scheduling optimization project and Pharmacy's PCA Pump Switch-Out project. Here's a link to the Miro board for the 3MBW Refresh project: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVND3xD4g=/

- Here's a Welcome Poster I created on Miro for the 3MBW project:

- Here's a Patient Experience Survey that I created on Miro. I collaborated with Volunteer Services to gather feedback directly from the patients. I analyzed the data and presented it to the Senior Leadership Team, physicians, managers, CPLs and frontline staff. I received praise for the design of this survey and was later asked to create a variation of it to support the End PJ Paralysis initiative under the Quality Improvement team.

- And finally, here's a link to my Canva, which I used to create graphics for many PowerPoint presentations that I delivered to the Senior's Health, Diabetes, Patient Access, Pharmacy and Physician teams at SHN: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF0NLnEjoE/PT96RXGW5A_rvLsAVM_AGg/edit?utm_content=DAF0NLnEjoE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

Thank you so much for taking the time to review my design portfolio and for considering me for the Marketing & Communications Coordinator position. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
