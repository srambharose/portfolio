1. Cornell Detailing (www.cornelldetailing.com)
This is my auto detailing brand that was created in September 2022. I have spent a considerable amount of time researching and designing the logo, UI/UX, colour palette, font choices and the overall feel of the brand. All webpages were designed in Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/SQxidSxgscnmfaBj1BJIXf/Cornell-Detailing-v2?node-id=0-1&t=IS19FE4tZcq617Uv-1

All of the HTML, CSS and Javascript code was written in Visual Studio Code. I purchased and configured the .com and .ca domains, as well as set up the web and email hosting. I use MailChimp to manage the email marketing campaigns:
