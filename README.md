This is my portfolio for the Marketing & Communications Coordinator position at SHN:

1. Cornell Detailing (www.cornelldetailing.com)
This company is a automotive detailing brand that was developed from the ground up by myself. I meticulously researched and designed the website in Figma. then wrote all of the HTML, CSS and Javascript in Visual Studio Code. Initially, I backed all of my code up on Github, but now I use Namecheap. I purchased and configured the .com and .ca domains, as well as set up the web and email hosting. I always kept security and accessibility in my mind as I connected each piece of technology, as I knew I would be handling sensitive information such as credit card information and addresses.
